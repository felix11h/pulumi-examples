** Pulumi examples

This repository contains standalone examples and demonstrations for defining and creating resources with Pulumi.

**** Dynamic resource local file provider

Fully local Pulumi project to demonstrate dynamic resource providers in Python.

To run locally first install the dependencies with Poetry, for example
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  poetry env use python && poetry install
#+END_SRC
if you want to use a Poetry virtual environment.

Then, in ~examples/dynamic-resource-local-file~, run
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  poetry run pulumi up
#+END_SRC

and follow the instructions to create a new stack. Your new stack can be found in ~.backend~ and created files
through the provider in the specified path, for example ~output/~.
